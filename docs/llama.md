# LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI)

LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) is a series of open-weight large language models (LLMs) developed by Meta (Facebook). These models are designed to be efficient, requiring significantly less computing power than other large models (like GPT-4), while still delivering strong performance in natural language tasks.

There are two versions of tools to manage LLaMA models:

* Llama.cpp
* Ollama

## Llama.cpp vs Ollama

| Feature | Llama.cpp | Ollama |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Low-level C++ implementation for running LLaMA models efficiently | High-level tool that simplifies running and managing LLMs |
| **Ease of Use** |
Requires manual setup, compilation, and command-line usage | User-friendly, with a built-in model management system |
| **Installation** |
Needs to be built from source or installed via scripts | One-line install (curl command) with automatic updates |
| **Supported Models** | Primarily LLaMA models, but others can be converted | Supports multiple models (LLaMA, Mistral, Gemma, etc.) |
| **Quantisation Support** | Supports GGUF format for efficient inference | Uses GGUF but abstracts the complexity for the user |
| **APIs & Extensibility** | No built-in API; needs extra scripting | Provides an easy-to-use API for integration |
| **Performance** | Highly optimised for low-level hardware use | Optimised but with some overhead for ease of use |
| **Customisation** | Full control over parameters, quantisation, and tuning | Limited customisation, more plug-and-play |
